Important notes:

- This work was generated automatically as an experiment and is provided for demonstration and exploration purposes only.
- The author does NOT endorse the design, implementation, or suitability of the generated code for production use.
- Treat this repository as a starting point for experimentation; review, refactor, and redesign before using any part of it in real projects.
